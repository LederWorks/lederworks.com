### GoLang Modules
As Go Modules in general importing several packages, I do not think that we need to include this information in the name of the respective repository.
- The second word is _easy_. If you implementing these standards somewhere else, this most possible will be yout company, organization etc. name.
- Any subsequent words should clearly state, what that module is used for. If it is used for terratests, then it should be _terratests_.

Example: `golang-easy-terratests`
