### Bicep Wrapper Modules
- The second word is _easy_. If you implementing these standards somewhere else, this most possible will be yout company, organization etc. name.
- The third word is _wrapper_.
- Any subsequent words should clearly state, what that module is used for. If it is deploying a DataBricks deployment in an island vnet, then it is going to be _databricks-isolated-vnet_.
  
Example: `bicep-easy-wrapper-databricks-isolated-vnet`
